**Project Title** : Online Store Application
**About the project:** The project is a platform to buy products online.
**Motivation:** I’m motivated to do this project to practice what I have learnt in class. But I have also a plan to upgrade it  by adding additional features for possible usage of own business. 

 I have used API to fetch data. Then, the application will display products per their category like:

**Summary of the project :** The API has lists of products with its name(title), descriptions, price, rating, pictures(image) and its category. These parameters will ease the user experience to use the system have a seamless connection as it will be explained below.

**The application has the following component:** 
1.	Home 
2.	Product Listing 
3.	Cart
4.	Footer
5.	NavBar 
6.	PrimaryContext
	
**The Home page:** Shows some pictures of products, name of the business, logos, Cart & Product listing links. It has also welcome message and footer.

**The Product page:** Shows the list of all products by its category. There is a button which enables us to extract products based on its category and here below are the buttons/category of the products:

•	**Jewelry** – when this button is clicked, only jewelry with its name and image will be displayed.
•	**Men’s Clothing** – when this button is clicked, only Men’s clothing with its name and image will be displayed.
•	**Women’s Clothing** – when this button is clicked, only women’s clothing with its name and image will be displayed.
•	**Electronics** – when this button is clicked, only Electronics with its name and image will be displayed.
•	**All Products together** – when this button is clicked, All products with its name and image will be displayed.

**The Product detail page** – the product listing page shows just name of the product and its picture. If the customer or user want to see the detail of a product, he/she needs to click either the image or name of the product then the application will take them to product detail page. In this page, the user will get additional information like, its price, detailed descriptions of the product and its rating in addition to name & image of the product.

If the customer decides to buy the product, then there is an **Add to Cart** button in product Details page, and when this button is clicked, it will take to Cart Page. Here the total price of the product will be calculated, and payment will be finalized. Once payment is done, thank you message & date and time will be displayed as an alert message.
**The footer** element will be displayed only in the home page and not on other pages for better visibility of products in the website.

This application is very simple to use and can be easily adaptable for any online stores be it clothing, shoes, electronics, liquor, supermarkets, pharmacies or any non-service business sectors. By doing so, for the sellers it will create huge market access and consequently it will increase revenue. For buyers, it will save time, energy and more importantly creates convenience. It will also decrease cost of products by avoiding intermediary costs.

**Built with**
The application is built with **REACT JS, Java Script, CSS & HTML.**

**Acknowledgement**
I would like to appreciate my instructor Mr Chase Van Halen for his continuous guidance and help in all aspects of this project.

**Installation** – the below application needs to run the program.
1. Visual Studio
2. Google Chrome
3. Node.js    https://nodejs.org
4. npm install react – it is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
5. npm install axios – it is a popular HTTP client library for making asynchronous request from a web broser or Node.js.
6. npm install react-router-dom – it is a routing library for react applications, enabling declarative routing and navigation.
**To be added features** – I have a plan to add credit card integration, Shipping details with tracking number and linking with databases. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
